## Project Description

**Partner Organization:** [Know Your Rights Camp – Autopsy Initiative](https://www.knowyourrightscamp.org/autopsyinitiative)  
**Project Title:** Independent Autopsy Findings  
**Faculty Advisor:** Michael Rosenblum  

### Project Summary

STATCOM is partnering with the [Know Your Rights Camp’s Autopsy Initiative](https://www.knowyourrightscamp.org/autopsyinitiative), a nonprofit organization that provides free secondary autopsies for families of individuals who died in police custody. The goals of the initiative are to increase transparency, support impacted families, and promote policy reform.

This project focuses on analyzing secondary autopsy data collected between 2022 and 2024. The project team will compile the data into a comprehensive report with two key objectives:  
1. Identify discrepancies between official (primary) and independent (secondary) autopsy findings.  
2. Conduct general trend analysis and produce visualizations that highlight patterns in the data.
