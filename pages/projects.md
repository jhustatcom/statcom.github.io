## Independent Autopsy Findings <small>(Fall 2025)</small>

**Partner:** [Know Your Rights Camp – Autopsy Initiative](https://www.knowyourrightscamp.org/autopsyinitiative)  
**Faculty Advisor:** Michael Rosenblum

STATCOM is partnering with the Know Your Rights Camp’s Autopsy Initiative, a nonprofit that provides free secondary autopsies for families of individuals who died in police custody. The initiative seeks to increase transparency, support impacted families, and promote policy reform.

This project focuses on analyzing secondary autopsy data collected between 2022 and 2024. The project team will compile the data into a comprehensive report with two key objectives:  
1. Identify discrepancies between official (primary) and independent (secondary) autopsy findings.  
2. Conduct trend analyses and create visualizations that highlight patterns in the data.
